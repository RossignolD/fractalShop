            condition on its ideals, you don't want to miss out on the
            Noetherian ring. Why settle for any old algebraic structure with two
            binary operations when you can have a Noetherian ring NOW for the
            low, LOW price of only $65.99. They're going fast, get 'em now!

            A pleasure to behold in both the mind's eye and the body's eye, the Klein bottle offers timeless
            mathematical beauty that can also serve a household function. After overcoming vapor lock,
            rotate the Klein bottle appropriately to fill with water, apple juice, or any other liquid you can imagine. Just don't let the liquid leak out of the outside/inside and into the outside/inside.
